# @tik-choco/mistai — shared LLM Network library

## Overview

This library consolidates the mistllm implementation that had been copied into
several apps (tc-mistllm / tc-translate / tc-pdf-viewer / tc-note): the wire
protocol, consumer/provider services, voice (TTS/STT), the OpenAI-compatible
upstream client, preact hooks, and — via the separate `@tik-choco/mistai/identity`
subpath — the DID delegation chain that lets a person be recognized as the
same identity across origins/devices.

- The protocol is **wire compatible (v: 1)** with the existing implementations.
  Old and new clients can share the same room.
- mistlib (wasm) is **not bundled**. Each app injects its own vendored mistlib
  node via `createNode`. Wiring the services directly to a custom transport
  (e.g. a Yjs collab room) is also supported.
- The core has no preact dependency. Hooks live in the separate
  `@tik-choco/mistai/preact` subpath; preact is an optional peerDependency.

## Architecture

### Roles

- **Consumer**: joins a room, collects every `provider_hello` into a provider
  table, and picks a provider per request: filter by required service
  (`chat` / `tts` / `stt`; a hello without `services` counts as chat-only),
  prefer an exact `models` match when a model is requested (falling back to a
  provider that advertises no models, sent without a model), pick randomly
  among ties, and fail over once to the next candidate on disconnect, timeout,
  or an `unsupported_service` error.
- **Provider**: joins a room, broadcasts `provider_hello` (with `services`
  derived from which upstream functions are injected), forwards incoming
  requests to the injected upstream functions (`LlmCallFn` / `SynthesizeFn` /
  `TranscribeFn`), streams the results back in chunks, and rejects requests
  for services it does not offer with an immediate `llm_error` / `voice_error`
  carrying `code: "unsupported_service"`.

### Protocol v1 message reference

| type | direction | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `provider_hello` | provider → all/peer | provider announcement. Optional `models: string[]` (upstream model list; backward-compatible extension) |
| `consumer_hello` | consumer → all/provider | consumer announcement (lets providers classify peers) |
| `llm_request` | consumer → provider | `id`, `messages: ChatMessage[]`, optional `model` |
| `llm_response_chunk` | provider → consumer | `id`, `delta`, optional `seq` (0-based, monotonic; absent = legacy arrival order) |
| `llm_response_done` | provider → consumer | `id`, optional `content` (falls back to the consumer's accumulated deltas) |
| `llm_error` | provider → consumer | `id`, `message` |
| `raft_message` | consumer ⇔ consumer | opaque scheduler payload (base64 bincode); passed through untouched at this layer |
| `tts_request` | consumer → provider | `id`, `text` (≤ 4000 chars), optional `model` / `voice` |
| `tts_response` | provider → consumer | `id`, `seq`, `data` (base64 sub-chunk), `last`, `mime` |
| `stt_request` | consumer → provider | `id`, `seq`, `data`, `last`, `mime`; `model` / `fileName` ride on seq 0 |
| `stt_response` | provider → consumer | `id`, `text` |
| `voice_error` | provider → consumer | `id`, `message` (shared error for tts/stt) |
| `oai_request` | consumer → provider | `id`, `seq`, `last`, `data` (base64 chunk); `path`/`method`/`contentType` ride on seq 0 |
| `oai_response` | provider → consumer | `id`, `seq`, `last`, `data`; `status`/`contentType` ride on seq 0 |
| `oai_error` | provider → consumer | `id`, `message`, optional `code` (`unsupported_path` / `request_rejected` / `request_too_large`) |

`decode()` trusts nothing: malformed messages return `null` (unknown fields are
stripped, `seq` must be an integer ≥ 0, `id` must be a non-empty string, and so
on). `provider_hello.models` is dropped as a field when it is not an array, and
non-string elements are filtered when it is — so the optional extension can
never break provider discovery itself.

### OAI tunnel (OpenAI-compatible HTTP over P2P)

`OaiTunnelClient` / `OaiTunnelProvider` (see `tunnel.ts`) proxy an arbitrary
OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint (`/chat/completions`, `/models`,
`/embeddings`, …) through a mist room, on top of the native `oai_*` messages
above — no separate codec needed, `Network`'s own `decode()` already
understands them. Why: it lets a consumer use *any* upstream feature (e.g.
vision/image inputs) that the request/response-shaped `llm_request` protocol
doesn't model, by tunneling the raw HTTP call instead of adding
feature-specific wire messages for each one.

- Bodies travel as 12 KB base64 chunks (mist's ~16 KB per-message safety
  margin), reassembled up to a 24 MB cap; requests time out after 120 s by
  default. A provider announces tunnel support by adding `'oai'`
  (`OAI_TUNNEL_SERVICE`) to `provider_hello.services`.
- **The consumer's credentials never touch the wire.** `oai_request` has no
  auth field by design — the provider always forwards to its own upstream
  with its own `OaiUpstream.apiKey`; a consumer can only reach whatever
  upstream(s) the provider's `OaiUpstreamResolver` chooses to expose.
- The resolver is the provider's policy boundary: return `null` to refuse a
  path outright (`unsupported_path`), or throw to refuse for a
  request-specific reason, e.g. an unshared model (`request_rejected`) — the
  thrown message is relayed to the consumer as-is.
- v1 has no streaming: the provider must resolve to a non-streaming upstream
  call (e.g. via `OaiUpstream.rewriteBody` forcing `stream: false`) and relay
  the full response in one shot. `/audio/*` is intentionally out of scope —
  that's what `tts_request`/`stt_request` are for.

```ts
import { OaiTunnelClient, OaiTunnelProvider } from '@tik-choco/mistai'

const tunnel = new OaiTunnelClient({ createNode, nodeIdStorageKey: 'my-app:node-id' })
const res = await tunnel.request(roomId, { path: '/chat/completions', body: JSON.stringify(payload) })

// Provider side: usually just pass resolveOaiUpstream to useNetworkProvider (below)
// instead of constructing OaiTunnelProvider directly.
```

### Shared MistNode facade (one node per page)

`createSharedNodeScope(createRealNode)` (see `shared-node.ts`) generalizes the
"one active MistNode per page" constraint some mistlib wasm wrappers enforce.
An app that runs more than one network stack at once — e.g. a `ConsumerClient`
*and* a `useNetworkProvider` *and* an `OaiTunnelClient` — would otherwise hit
each stack trying to construct its own real node. A shared scope instead hands
out lightweight handles that multiplex onto one real node: events fan out to
every handle (filtered by the rooms *that handle* joined), and room departure
is reference-counted across handles so one stack disconnecting doesn't evict a
room-mate. The one real consequence: every handle sharing a scope is one peer
on the wire, so a page's own provider can't be "discovered" by that same
page's consumer if they share a scope (mist doesn't loop broadcasts back to
the sender) — a degenerate case with no practical loss.

```ts
import { createSharedNodeScope } from '@tik-choco/mistai'
import { MistNode } from '../vendor/mistlib/wrappers/web/index.js'

// Once per page, reused as `createNode` by every stack that should share an identity:
export const createSharedMistNode = createSharedNodeScope((nodeId) => new MistNode(nodeId))
```

Apps with only one network stack alive at a time don't need this — pass the
raw `(id) => new MistNode(id)` factory directly, as in the examples below.

### Transport injection

The library never imports mistlib. `Network` / `ConsumerClient` /
`useNetworkProvider` accept `createNode: (nodeId) => MistNodeLike`, and
anything satisfying `MistNodeLike` (`init` / `onEvent` / `joinRoom` /
`leaveRoom` / `sendMessage`) works. The mist event/delivery constants
(`EVENT_RAW=0`, `EVENT_PEER_CONNECTED=5`, `EVENT_PEER_DISCONNECTED=6`,
`DELIVERY_RELIABLE=0`) are re-declared and exported by the library.

At a lower level, `ConsumerService` / `ProviderService` /
`VoiceConsumerService` / `VoiceProviderService` take only a
`SendFn = (toId, msg) => void`, so they can be wired straight into a custom
transport that doesn't involve mist at all (see pattern B below).

### One MistNode per page

The mistlib wasm node assumes one node and one room per page. Running the
consumer and provider on the same page at the same time requires app-side room
arbitration (something like tc-pdf-viewer's claimRoom/releaseRoom), **or**
`createSharedNodeScope` (see "Shared MistNode facade" above), which multiplexes
any number of `Network`-owning stacks onto one real node without app-side
arbitration. `ConsumerClient` and `useNetworkProvider` each create their own
`Network` (= node) via the injected `createNode`, so whether that's one real
node or several depends entirely on what `createNode` returns.

## API reference (summary)

### `@tik-choco/mistai`

- **protocol** — `encode(msg)` / `decode(bytes|string)`, every message
  interface, the `ProtocolMessage` union, `ChatMessage`.
- **base64** — `blobToBase64` / `base64ToBlob` / `chunkBase64` /
  `VOICE_CHUNK_SIZE` (12 KB), plus the byte/text-level primitives they're built
  on: `bytesToBase64` / `base64ToBytes` / `utf8ToBase64` / `base64ToUtf8`.
  `blobToBase64` does not use FileReader (works in Node too).
- **messages** — `MistaiMessages` catalogs `MESSAGES_EN` / `MESSAGES_JA`
  (canonical status labels + one message per error code) and
  `formatMistaiError(err, messages, fallback?)` /
  `formatMistaiCode(code, messages)`. See "Error handling and localization".
- **id** — `randomId()` (UUID that also works outside secure contexts),
  `getPersistentNodeId(storageKey = "mistai:node-id")` (falls back to memory
  when localStorage is unavailable; never throws).
- **consumer** — `ConsumerService(send)`.
  `request(providerId, messages, { model?, onDelta?, timeoutMs? })` handles seq
  reordering, duplicate dropping, and legacy no-seq senders. With `timeoutMs`
  set, the inactivity timer resets on every received chunk. `rejectAll(err)`
  rejects every in-flight request (for provider disconnects).
- **provider** — `ProviderService(send, callLlm, { onRequestLog?, maxLogEntries? })`.
  Keeps request logs (`started` / `streaming` / `done` / `error`, `charCount`,
  `detail`); `getLogs()` returns newest first.
- **voice-consumer** — `VoiceConsumerService(send, options?)`. `requestTts` /
  `requestStt` / `rejectAll` / `handleMessage`. Defaults: 120 s timeout, 24 M
  base64-char audio cap, 4000-char TTS text cap (all overridable via options).
- **voice-provider** — `VoiceProviderService(send, synthesize, transcribe, options?)`.
  In-order chunk reassembly, 16 concurrent STT streams max (overridable),
  `dropPeer(fromId)`.
- **openai** — `streamChatCompletion(config, messages, onDelta?, fetchFn?)`
  (SSE streaming with a non-streaming JSON fallback; `temperature` /
  `reasoningEffort` are only sent when set), `fetchModels(config, fetchFn?)`.
- **node** — `Network({ createNode, nodeId?, nodeIdStorageKey?, callbacks? })`.
  `join(roomId)` / `send(toId | null, msg)` (always `DELIVERY_RELIABLE`) /
  `leave()` / `destroy()`. Includes disposal-race guards (events from a
  replaced node are ignored; destroy during init leaves immediately).
- **client** — `ConsumerClient({ createNode, nodeIdStorageKey?, providerWaitTimeoutMs?, requestTimeoutMs? })`.
  `connect(roomId)` (eager, never throws) / `disconnect()` / `requestChat` /
  `requestTts` / `requestStt`, plus `status` + `onStatusChange`
  (`idle → joining → searching → connected/error`; `connected` carries
  `providerId` and `models?`). Sends `consumer_hello` after joining and upon
  receiving a `provider_hello`.
- **tunnel** — `OaiTunnelClient({ createNode, nodeIdStorageKey, requestTimeoutMs? })`
  (`request(roomId, { path, method?, contentType?, body? })` → `{ status, contentType, body }`,
  `disconnect()`) and `OaiTunnelProvider(send, resolveUpstream)`
  (`handleMessage(fromId, msg)` returns `true` when it consumed an `oai_*`
  message, `dropPeer(peerId)`). See "OAI tunnel" above.
- **shared-node** — `createSharedNodeScope(createRealNode)` → a `createNode`
  factory that multiplexes every handle it produces onto one real node. See
  "Shared MistNode facade" above.

### `@tik-choco/mistai/preact`

- `useConsumerStatus(client)` — subscribes to `ConsumerStatus`.
- `useConsumerConnection(client, { enabled, roomId, debounceMs? })` —
  side-effect hook: debounced `connect` while enabled, `disconnect` when
  disabled.
- `useNetworkProvider({ enabled, roomId, createNode, callLlm?, synthesize?, transcribe?, advertisedModels?, extraServices?, resolveOaiUpstream?, ... })`
  — manages the provider join/leave lifecycle and returns
  `{ status, statusUpdatedAt, errorMessage, peers, peerCount, consumerCount, logs, ownNodeId, roomId }`.
  Broadcasts `provider_hello` (with `models` when `advertisedModels` is set,
  and `services` derived from which of `callLlm` / `synthesize` / `transcribe`
  are injected, plus `extraServices` and — automatically — `'oai'` whenever
  `resolveOaiUpstream` is set) after joining and to each newly connected peer,
  and marks peers that send `consumer_hello` as consumers. Requests for a
  service that is not injected are rejected with `code: "unsupported_service"`.
  **Hello re-broadcast**: whenever the advertised set (services/extraServices/
  oai/advertisedModels) changes while already connected, a fresh
  `provider_hello` is sent to every peer in place — no leave/rejoin, so
  in-flight requests survive a live share-list edit. (Consumers already apply
  `provider_hello` updates mid-session, so this alone closes the loop.)
  **oai tunnel**: passing `resolveOaiUpstream` wires an internal
  `OaiTunnelProvider` into the hook's own message routing (consulted before
  everything else) and drops its per-peer state on disconnect — see "OAI
  tunnel" above for the resolver contract.

Shared UI components (all take an optional `messages: MistaiMessages`,
default `MESSAGES_EN`; import the default styles via
`import '@tik-choco/mistai/ui.css'` and theme with `--mistai-*` CSS custom
properties — border, surface, text, text-muted, text-strong):

- `ConsumerStatusIndicator({ status, updatedAt?, variant?, note?, messages? })`
  — colored dot + status label with a click-to-open detail popover (step
  progression, provider id, localized error).
- `ConsumerStepIndicator({ status, messages? })` — standalone
  idle → joining → searching → connected step row.
- `ProviderStatusPanel({ status, statusUpdatedAt?, errorMessage?, ownNodeId?, peers, consumerCount, logs, notice?, logPageSize?, messages? })`
  — provider summary line, app-supplied `notice` slot, collapsible peer list
  and request log with paging.
- `consumerErrorText(status, messages)` — localized error string for an
  error-phase `ConsumerStatus` (catalog code first, raw message fallback).

### `@tik-choco/mistai/identity`

DID delegation chains: a permanent "root" identity (typically custodied by
`mistl`, so it survives across every browser/origin) signs a short-lived
authorization for an origin-local "leaf" key, so peers can recognize the same
person across origins/devices without sharing raw private keys. Chain depth
is fixed at 1 (root → leaf, no sub-delegation), there is no revocation list
(delegations just expire and get reissued), and every receive-side check is
backward compatible — a wire with no `delegation` field, or a peer that has
never heard of delegation chains, behaves exactly as before. Full spec:
`protocol/docs/data-contracts/docs/did-delegation.md` in the protocol repo;
this subpath and mistl's `src/identity/{delegation,pairing}.rs` are the two
canonical implementations peers must interoperate with.

Not re-exported from the package root (like `llm-config`) — `did:key`
generation/signing lives in `didKey.ts`, separate from `id.ts`'s
`randomId`/`getPersistentNodeId` so the two don't collide.

- **didKey** — `PublicDidIdentity` / `DidIdentity` types, `createDidIdentity()`
  / `publicDidIdentity()` / `parseStoredDidIdentity()`,
  `signStringWithDidIdentity()` / `verifyStringWithDid()`, and the did:key
  codec (`didKeyFromEd25519PublicKey`, `didKeyFromPublicKeyMultibase`,
  `ed25519PublicKeyFromDidKey`, `isEd25519DidKey`,
  `publicKeyMultibaseFromEd25519`). Ported with identical semantics from
  tc-storage's `src/crypto/didIdentity.ts` — everything except localStorage
  access (that's `./store.ts`'s job here, not this module's).
- **delegation** — `DelegationV1` type, `signDelegation(rootIdentity, leaf, { ttlMs?, now? })`
  (default TTL 60 days), `verifyDelegation(delegation, { now?, leaf? })`
  (checks all 8 rules from the spec: shape, both ends are Ed25519 did:keys,
  `root !== leaf`, `iat < exp`, lifetime ≤ 400 days, ±5 min clock skew, valid
  signature, and — when `leaf` is passed — an exact leaf match),
  `parseDelegation(raw)` (shape-only, no signature check — for a pasted/manual
  transfer), `delegationSigningPayload(d)`.
- **store** — `SHARED_DELEGATION_KEY` ("tc-shared-did-delegation-v1", the
  cross-app co-owned localStorage key, same last-write-wins pattern as
  `tc-shared-llm-config-v1`), `loadDelegation()` / `saveDelegation()` /
  `clearDelegation()`, `loadDelegationFor(leaf)` (verified read — returns
  the stored delegation only if it verifies for `leaf`; a broken/expired/
  foreign-leaf value is ignored WITHOUT clearing the key, since it may
  belong to a different leaf sharing this origin), `subscribeDelegation(cb)`
  (cross-tab `storage` event, mirrors `llm-config.ts`'s `subscribeLlmConfig`).
- **wire** — `signWireWithDelegation(fields, identity, delegation?)` (attaches
  `delegation` *before* signing so it's protected by the signature too),
  `verifyWire(wire)` (signature-only — the delegation-unaware baseline check),
  `resolveWireSender(wire, { now? })` → `ResolvedSender | null` (`null` only
  if the wire's own signature fails; a broken delegation degrades to the leaf
  identity rather than dropping the message).
- **pairing** — browser side of "経路A: ペアリング" (mistl issues a delegation
  over a throwaway mist room derived from a short code, e.g. `mistl key pair`).
  `normalizePairingCode(input)` / `formatPairingCode(code)` /
  `generatePairingCode()`, `pairingRoomId(code)` / `pairingMacKey(code)` /
  `computePairingMac(msg, macKey)` (the room id / MAC key derivation — kept
  byte-compatible with mistl's Rust port via cross-implementation test
  vectors), `requestDelegation({ code, leaf, app, createNode, timeoutMs?, resendIntervalMs? })`
  — joins the derived room, resends a MAC'd request every 3s (default) until
  a MAC-valid response or error arrives or 60s (default) elapses, and always
  leaves the room before settling either way.

Typical flow for an app adopting root/leaf identity (e.g. tc-storage,
tc-chat):

```ts
import { ensureDidIdentity } from './crypto/didIdentity.js' // the app's own leaf identity
import {
  loadDelegationFor, saveDelegation, requestDelegation,
  signWireWithDelegation, resolveWireSender,
} from '@tik-choco/mistai/identity'

// 1. Receive a delegation once (pairing, or pasted from `mistl key delegate`).
const leaf = await ensureDidIdentity()
const delegation = await requestDelegation({
  code: userTypedCode,
  leaf: leaf.did,
  app: 'tc-storage',
  createNode: (id) => new MistNode(id),
})
saveDelegation(delegation)

// 2. Attach it whenever signing an outgoing wire.
const delegation = await loadDelegationFor(leaf.did)
const wire = await signWireWithDelegation({ fromId: leaf.did, ...fields }, leaf, delegation)

// 3. Resolve the sender's identity on receive (root when delegated, else leaf).
const sender = await resolveWireSender(wire)
if (sender) recordAuthor(sender.id) // same person across origins when delegated
```

## Getting started

### Install

The package is not published to npm. Install it straight from GitHub — the
`prepare` script builds `dist/` automatically during install:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tik-choco/mistai": "github:tik-choco-lab/mistai"
  }
}
```

To pin a specific version, append a tag or commit:
`github:tik-choco-lab/mistai#v0.1.0`.

Alternatively, when developing the library and an app side by side with
sibling checkouts, a local file reference avoids reinstalling on every change:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tik-choco/mistai": "file:../mistai"
  }
}
```

With `file:`, run `npm install` once inside mistai first so the `prepare`
script builds `dist/`, then run `npm install` in the app.

### Pattern A: apps with a mistlib node (tc-translate / tc-pdf-viewer / tc-chat / tc-storage / tc-vrm-viewer)

Inject the vendored mistlib wrapper's `MistNode`.

Consumer side:

```ts
import { ConsumerClient } from '@tik-choco/mistai'
import { MistNode } from '../vendor/mistlib/wrappers/web/index.js'

export const llmClient = new ConsumerClient({
  createNode: (id) => new MistNode(id),
  nodeIdStorageKey: 'tc-translate-mistllm-node-id-v1', // to keep an app's existing key
})

// from the UI
const reply = await llmClient.requestChat(roomId, messages, { model, onDelta })
const audio = await llmClient.requestTts(roomId, { text, model, voice })
const text = await llmClient.requestStt(roomId, { audio: blob, model, fileName })
```

Provider side (preact):

```ts
import { streamChatCompletion } from '@tik-choco/mistai'
import { useNetworkProvider } from '@tik-choco/mistai/preact'
import { MistNode } from '../vendor/mistlib/wrappers/web/index.js'

const provider = useNetworkProvider({
  enabled: settings.networkProviderEnabled,
  roomId: settings.roomId,
  createNode: (id) => new MistNode(id),
  callLlm: (messages, model, onDelta) =>
    streamChatCompletion(
      { baseUrl: settings.baseUrl, apiKey: settings.apiKey, model: model ?? settings.model },
      messages,
      onDelta,
    ),
  synthesize: async (text, model, voice) => ({ blob: await ttsUpstream(text, model, voice), mime: 'audio/mpeg' }),
  transcribe: (audio, mime, model, fileName) => sttUpstream(audio, model, fileName),
  advertisedModels: models, // e.g. fetchModels() results, published as provider_hello.models
})
```

### Pattern B: apps with a custom transport (tc-note's Yjs collab room)

When mist is not involved, wire a `SendFn` directly:

```ts
import { ConsumerService, ProviderService, decode, encode } from '@tik-choco/mistai'

// sending: put messages on your own transport
const consumer = new ConsumerService((toId, msg) => room.sendTo(toId, encode(msg)))
const provider = new ProviderService((toId, msg) => room.sendTo(toId, encode(msg)), callLlm)

// receiving: decode bytes from the transport and dispatch
room.onMessage((fromId, bytes) => {
  const msg = decode(bytes)
  if (!msg) return
  consumer.handleMessage(msg)
  void provider.handleMessage(fromId, msg)
})
```

### Migration map from existing apps

**tc-translate `src/lib/mistllm/*` → mistai**

| old | new |
|---|---|
| `protocol.ts` | `@tik-choco/mistai` (`encode` / `decode` / types) |
| `base64.ts` | `@tik-choco/mistai` (`blobToBase64` etc.) |
| `randomId` in `node.ts` | `randomId` |
| `Network` in `node.ts` | `Network` (now takes an injected `createNode`) |
| `consumer.ts` | `ConsumerService` (`request` now takes an options object) |
| `provider.ts` | `ProviderService` (same API) |
| `voice-consumer.ts` / `voice-provider.ts` | `VoiceConsumerService` / `VoiceProviderService` |
| `client.ts` (module singleton) | a `ConsumerClient` instance (make it a singleton in the app) |
| `hooks/useNetworkConsumerStatus.ts` | `useConsumerStatus` in `@tik-choco/mistai/preact` |
| `hooks/useNetworkConsumerConnection.ts` | `useConsumerConnection` |
| `hooks/useNetworkProvider.ts` | `useNetworkProvider` (options no longer tied to app settings) |

**tc-note `src/lib/mistllm/*` → mistai**

| old | new |
|---|---|
| `protocol.ts` | `@tik-choco/mistai` |
| `consumer.ts` / `provider.ts` | `ConsumerService` / `ProviderService` (direct SendFn, pattern B) |

**tc-pdf-viewer `src/services/mistllm.js` → mistai**

| old | new |
|---|---|
| protocol part (incl. `provider_hello.models`) | `@tik-choco/mistai` |
| `NetworkChatClient` (timeouts, provider wait) | `ConsumerClient` (`providerWaitTimeoutMs` / `requestTimeoutMs`) |
| provider part | `ProviderService` + `useNetworkProvider` (`advertisedModels`) |
| claimRoom/releaseRoom single-node arbitration | stays in the app (out of scope for the library) |

### Notes

- **mistlib wasm is not bundled.** Inject each app's vendored mistlib via
  `createNode`.
- The localStorage node-id key defaults to `mistai:node-id`; pass an app's old
  key (e.g. `tc-translate-mistllm-node-id-v1`) as `nodeIdStorageKey` to keep an
  existing identity.
- The protocol is wire compatible (v: 1) with the existing implementations.
  Old clients/providers and this library can share a room
  (`provider_hello.models` and `seq` are optional extensions).
- `ConsumerClient.connect()` never throws. Receive errors via
  `onStatusChange` as `{ phase: 'error' }`.

## Error handling and localization

The library's default messages are English, but apps are expected to be
multilingual. Every failure the library generates locally is a `MistaiError`
with a stable `code` (`MistaiErrorCode`), so UIs should localize by mapping
the code rather than displaying or matching the English `message`.

For consistency across apps, the library ships canonical UI wording as
`MistaiMessages` catalogs (`MESSAGES_EN`, `MESSAGES_JA`): status labels for
the consumer lifecycle (full and step-indicator forms), provider status, the
provider request log, and one message per error code. Use these instead of
hand-rolling labels so terminology doesn't drift between apps:

```ts
import { MESSAGES_JA, formatMistaiError, formatMistaiCode } from '@tik-choco/mistai'

// Status labels
label = MESSAGES_JA.consumerPhase[status.phase]

// Error display (REMOTE_ERROR passes the remote-authored message through)
try {
  await llmClient.requestChat(roomId, messages)
} catch (err) {
  showToast(formatMistaiError(err, MESSAGES_JA, 'Request failed.'))
}

// ConsumerStatus error phase carries a code when one applies
message = formatMistaiCode(status.code, MESSAGES_JA) ?? status.message
```

Apps supporting other languages provide their own `MistaiMessages` object
with the same shape (the `errors` record is exhaustive over
`MistaiErrorCode`, so a missing translation is a type error).

- `MistaiError.details` carries interpolation values (e.g. `{ status: 401 }`
  for `UPSTREAM_HTTP_ERROR`).
- `ConsumerStatus`'s `{ phase: 'error' }` also includes the `code` when one
  applies (`PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND`, `JOIN_FAILED`).
- Errors relayed from a remote peer (`llm_error` / `voice_error`) have code
  `REMOTE_ERROR`; their `message` text is authored by the remote provider and
  arrives in whatever language that provider runs in — it cannot be localized
  on the consumer side.
